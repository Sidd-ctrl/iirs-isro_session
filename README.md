# ML for Geospatial Data Analysis - IIRS ISRO


This repository contains projects and insights from my AI/ML-based Geospatial Data Analysis training at Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS), ISRO. The program focused on applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze remote sensing and geospatial data.

Key Learnings & Implementations:
✅ Preprocessing and visualization of geospatial datasets
✅ Training ML models for satellite image classification
✅ Google Earth Engine (GEE) for remote sensing applications
✅ Handling large-scale geospatial data with Python

Tech Stack & Tools:
Languages: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, py-torch

Platforms: Google Earth Engine, QGIS

This repository includes code, datasets, and documentation from the training program.
